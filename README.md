## Development ðŸ’»

Here are the steps to run the project locally.

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ccrsxx/twitter-clone.git
   ```

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

1. Create a Firebase project and select the web app

1. Add your Firebase config to `.env.development`. Note that `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEASUREMENT_ID` is optional

1. Make sure you have enabled the following Firebase services:

   - Authentication. Enable the Google sign-in method.
   - Cloud Firestore. Create a database and set its location to your nearest region.
   - Cloud Storage. Create a storage bucket.

1. Install Firebase CLI globally

   ```bash
   npm i -g firebase-tools
   ```

1. Log in to Firebase

   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

1. Get your project ID

   ```bash
   firebase projects:list
   ```

1. Select your project ID

   ```bash
   firebase use your-project-id
   ```

1. Deploy Firestore rules, Firestore indexes, and Cloud Storage rules

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --except functions
   ```

1. Run the project

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

> **_Note_**: When you deploy Firestore indexes rules, it might take a few minutes to complete. So before the indexes are enabled, you will get an error when you fetch the data from Firestore.<br><br>You can check the status of your Firestore indexes with the link below, replace `your-project-id` with your project ID: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/your-project-id/firestore/indexes

Optional:

- If you want to get trending data from Twitter API, you need to create a Twitter developer account and get your API keys. Then add your API keys to `.env.development`. I hope Elon Musk doesn't make this API paid ðŸ˜….
- If you want to make the user stats synced with the deleted tweets, you need to enable the Cloud Functions for Firebase. Then deploy the Cloud Functions.
